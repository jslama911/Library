This app is designed to help you keep track of the books you have read. 
It allows you to store information such as title, author, rating, and any notes you want to keep about the book. 

Clicking the Add book button opens up an off canvas form that allows you to put in a book of your choosing. 

You are able to delete any book (including the two that are show on loading) with the delete buttons.
